  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="stagger">
    <h3 class="about-section-title" style="--i:1">Where Curiosity Started</h3>
    <p style="--i:2">
      I’ve always been drawn to the places where curiosity meets complexity. 
      In college, that meant splitting my time between two very different worlds: prehistoric European history and computer science. 
      One taught me how to think about people across vast stretches of time — 
      how cultures evolve, how tools shape societies, how stories survive. 
      The other taught me how to build things from nothing but logic and imagination.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-section-title" style="--i:3">Finding My Place in Tech</h3>
    <p style="--i:4">
      Even though I explored a wide range of programming languages and paradigms, I kept finding myself pulled toward the web. 
      There was something irresistible about creating experiences people could touch, navigate, and feel — 
      something immediate and human about shaping interfaces that connect people to information and to each other. 
      That pull eventually became my focus: 
      building clean, scalable, intuitive applications that make someone’s day a little easier.

    <h3 class="about-section-title" style="--i:5">Life on the Water</h3>
    <p style="--i:6">
      Outside the classroom, I spent years in another world defined by precision and pressure: competitive rowing. 
      I wasn’t just in the boat — I was the coxswain, 
      the voice and the strategist, the one responsible for steering, pacing, and holding the crew together when everything hurt. 
      My proudest moment came at the Head of the Charles, the world’s largest and most prestigious regatta. 
      It’s known as a “coxswain’s race” for a reason: 
      the course is narrow, technical, and unforgiving, with bridges and turns that punish even the smallest mistake.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-section-title" style="--i:7">A Defining Race</h3>
    <p style="--i:8">
      That day, we didn’t just survive it — we passed seven boats, something almost unheard of on a course that chaotic and cutthroat. 
      We earned a medal, but more importantly, I learned what it means to stay calm in the middle of chaos, 
      to make decisions under pressure, and to guide a team through something that feels impossible.
    </p>

    <h3 class="about-section-title" style="--i:9">How It Shapes My Work</h3>
    <p style="--i:10">
      Those lessons show up in my work every day. 
      Whether I’m architecting a feature, debugging a stubborn issue, or refining a user experience, 
      I bring the same mindset I learned on the river and in the archives: stay curious, stay steady, and build with intention. 
      I’m driven by the belief that good software — like good history and good rowing — 
      is ultimately about people, and about the impact you leave behind.
